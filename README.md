In this project, data science and machine learning techniques were used to predict the international film revenue using internal and external film-based features (e.g. gross domestic product (GDP), percentage of internet usage globally and world population count beside unemployment in the world each year). 

Python and Tableau were used in this project for coding and visualization. The data were collected from many sources and merged together to create collective dataset which has been processed through data analysis cycle by assessing, cleaning and exploration before applying feature engineering steps to further selecting the best relative effective features and even extracting new features from existing ones. 

Therefore, machine learning techniques for both regression “value estimate” and classification are used to predict the film revenue. The best results were achieved by Catboost (algorithm), as an estimate problem, by achieving average accuracy of 89.4%. Whereas, as a classification problem, the average accuracy achieved was 95%, 87.1% for binary classification and multi class classification respectively by extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model and random forest respectively. 

Moreover, the proposed added external features have proven to be effective in predicting the film revenue as they were selected by feature engineering techniques to be among the top features that affect the model prediction performance. Additionally, the effect of COVID-19 was shown in dropping the revenue of the films during the pandemic years (2020-2022).Furthermore, the results were verified through the k-fold cross validation technique.
